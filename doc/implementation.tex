\section{ROS as an inter-process communication service}

\section{OpenNI RGB-D camera driver}
- depth registration
- rectified images

\section{Creating and using Mipmaps to reduce the initial number of features}

\section{SIFT Feature Detection and Matching}
- cutting keypoints from already recognized objects to enable recognition of multiple objects of the same type and to not need to match keypoints to multiple sample images (speed up)

\section{Filtering Matches to discard false positives}

\section{Calculating the 3D Pose of recognized objects}

\section{Memorising repeatedly confirmed and forgetting disappeared objects}

\section{Evaluating the relevance of memorized objects}

\section{Visualising the Semantic Map}
